# StreamlinedRepo
An experiment to automate aspects of my development process in GitHub

1. [X] **Create a PR when pushing a branch.** 
    - If the PR already exists, don't recreate it. 
    - Use the first commit message as the PR name 
2. [ ] Stream line Dependabot for trusted repos
3. [ ] Merge PR: can we delete local branches too
